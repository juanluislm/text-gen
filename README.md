# text-gen

To-Do:

1) Extend the model to have multiple LSTM hidden layers
2) Extend the model to use pre-trained word2vec or GloVe vectors
3) Split the raw data based on sentences and pad each sentence to a fixed length
4) Tune the size of the embedding or number of memory cells in the hidden layer?
